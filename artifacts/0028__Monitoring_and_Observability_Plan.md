3. Monitoring and Observability Processes
3.1 Metrics Collection

Purpose: Track performance and health of AIC-Platform components (NFR29).
Process:
Instrumentation: Add Prometheus exporters to microservices, AI pipelines, and databases.
Example: prometheus.io/scrape: true in Kubernetes pod annotations.


Collection: Scrape metrics every 10 seconds via Prometheus.
Storage: Store metrics in Prometheus with 30-day retention.
Visualization: Display metrics in Grafana dashboards (NFR33).


Key Metrics:
Microservices: CPU usage (container_cpu_usage_seconds_total), memory (container_memory_usage_bytes).
APIs: Latency (http_request_duration_seconds), error rate (http_requests_total{status="500"}).
AI Pipelines: Model accuracy, inference latency (FR10).
Data Layer: Query latency, throughput (FR16–FR18).
Sustainability: Carbon emissions (kg CO2e) (NFR41).


Example:apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
    prometheus.io/port: "8080"
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-app
    image: my-app:latest


SRD Mappings: NFR29, NFR33, NFR41.

3.2 Log Aggregation

Purpose: Collect and analyze logs for debugging and compliance (NFR29, NFR34).
