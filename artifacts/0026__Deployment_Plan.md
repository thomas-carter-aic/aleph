Deployment Plan
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This Deployment Plan outlines the strategy for rolling out AIC-Platform across development, staging, and production environments, ensuring reliable, scalable, and secure deployments that meet the SRD’s functional (e.g., FR1–FR45), non-functional (e.g., NFR1–NFR49), and technical requirements (e.g., TR1–TR5, TR22–TR24). The plan supports the platform’s goal of achieving 2 million users and $2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2045.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the deployment strategy for AIC-Platform, detailing the phases, processes, environments, and tools for deploying microservices, AI/ML pipelines, data layer, and PaaS applications. It guides DevOps teams, developers, and partners in executing deployments, ensuring alignment with the Product Vision Document, Business Case, Market Analysis Report, GTM Strategy, IP Strategy, System Architecture Document (SAD), API Specification, Data Model and Schema Design, Security Architecture Document, AI/ML Pipeline Design, Coding Standards and Guidelines, Test Plan, and CI/CD Pipeline Configuration.
