Risk Management Plan
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This Risk Management Plan identifies, assesses, and mitigates risks associated with the development, deployment, and operation of AIC-Platform, ensuring the platform meets its strategic objectives of achieving 2 million users and $2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2045. It addresses risks outlined in the SRD (R1–R8), functional requirements (e.g., FR1–FR45), non-functional requirements (e.g., NFR1–NFR49), and technical requirements (e.g., TR1–TR25), aligning with the Product Vision Document, Business Case, Market Analysis Report, GTM Strategy, IP Strategy, System Architecture Document (SAD), API Specification, Data Model and Schema Design, Security Architecture Document, AI/ML Pipeline Design, Coding Standards and Guidelines, Test Plan, CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Templates, Deployment Plan, Operations Runbook, Monitoring and Observability Plan, SLA Document, Developer Documentation, User Guides and Tutorials, Certification Program Curriculum, Community Guidelines, Compliance Plan, and AI Ethics and Governance Framework.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive framework for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating risks throughout the AIC-Platform project lifecycle. It guides project managers, developers, DevOps teams, and stakeholders in proactively managing risks to ensure the platform’s success, reliability, and compliance, supporting its 20-year competitive moat.
