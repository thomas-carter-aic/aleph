API Specification
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This API Specification defines the interfaces for external and internal interactions with AIC-Platform, enabling developers, enterprises, and third-party services to integrate seamlessly with the platform’s microservices, AI/ML pipelines, data services, and PaaS capabilities. The APIs support the SRD’s functional requirements (e.g., FR28, FR30, FR33, FR35) and non-functional requirements (e.g., NFR9, NFR13–NFR15, NFR48), ensuring high performance, security, and backward compatibility.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed specification of AIC-Platform’s APIs, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and versioning policies. It serves as a reference for development teams, external developers, and partners, ensuring consistent and secure integration across the platform’s ecosystem. The API Specification aligns with the Product Vision Document, Business Case, Market Analysis Report, GTM Strategy, IP Strategy, and System Architecture Document (SAD), supporting AIC-Platform’s goal of achieving 2 million active users and $2 billion ARR by 2045.
