CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This CI/CD Pipeline Configuration document specifies the setup and workflows for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, enabling automated building, testing, and deployment of microservices, AI/ML models, and PaaS applications. It addresses the SRD’s technical requirements (TR1, TR3–TR5, TR7–TR8), functional requirements (FR1–FR45), and non-functional requirements (NFR1–NFR49), ensuring rapid, reliable, and secure delivery of software updates.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the configuration of AIC-Platform’s CI/CD pipelines, providing a standardized framework for development teams, DevOps engineers, and third-party contributors to automate code integration, testing, and deployment. It ensures alignment with the Product Vision Document, Business Case, Market Analysis Report, GTM Strategy, IP Strategy, System Architecture Document (SAD), API Specification, Data Model and Schema Design, Security Architecture Document, AI/ML Pipeline Design, Coding Standards and Guidelines, and Test Plan, supporting AIC-Platform’s goal of achieving 2 million users and $2 billion ARR by 2045.
1.2 Scope

Run Tests: Unit, integration, and security tests (PyTest, Snyk).
Generate Coverage: Publish to Codecov (100% for critical components).
Report Results: Notify via GitHub status checks.




Example (GitHub Actions):name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [feature/*]
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
