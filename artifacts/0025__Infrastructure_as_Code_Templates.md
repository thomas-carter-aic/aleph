Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Templates
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Templates document specifies the configurations for provisioning and managing AIC-Platform’s infrastructure, including multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters, edge computing environments, databases, and future compute paradigms (e.g., quantum and neuromorphic). It addresses the SRD’s technical requirements (TR2, TR18, TR22, TR24), non-functional requirements (NFR3–NFR8, NFR13–NFR23, NFR40–NFR43), and functional requirements (FR1–FR45), ensuring reproducible, automated, and sustainable infrastructure deployments.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide standardized IaC templates for AIC-Platform’s infrastructure, enabling DevOps teams, developers, and partners to deploy and manage resources consistently across environments. It ensures alignment with the Product Vision Document, Business Case, Market Analysis Report, GTM Strategy, IP Strategy, System Architecture Document (SAD), API Specification, Data Model and Schema Design, Security Architecture Document, AI/ML Pipeline Design, Coding Standards and Guidelines, Test Plan, and CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, supporting AIC-Platform’s goal of achieving 2 million users and $2 billion ARR by 2045.
1.2 Scope
The IaC Templates cover:

Provisioning of multi-cloud Kubernetes clusters (NFR3).
Configuration of edge computing environments (FR23–FR24).
Setup of polyglot databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra) (TR15).
Deployment of AI/ML compute resources (GPU/TPU, quantum, neuromorphic) (TR10, TR22).
