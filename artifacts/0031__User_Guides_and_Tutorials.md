User Guides and Tutorials
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This User Guides and Tutorials document provides step-by-step instructions for end-users (developers, administrators, and business users) to manage applications, monitor performance, and leverage AI-driven features on AIC-Platform. It addresses the SRD’s functional requirements (e.g., FR1–FR45), non-functional requirements (e.g., NFR9, NFR13–NFR33, NFR44–NFR46), and technical requirements (e.g., TR1–TR5), supporting the platform’s goal of achieving 2 million users and $2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2045.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to guide end-users and administrators in using AIC-Platform’s developer portal, command-line interface (CLI), and APIs to configure, deploy, and monitor applications. It ensures rapid onboarding, ease of use, and alignment with the Product Vision Document, Business Case, Market Analysis Report, GTM Strategy, IP Strategy, System Architecture Document (SAD), API Specification, Data Model and Schema Design, Security Architecture Document, AI/ML Pipeline Design, Coding Standards and Guidelines, Test Plan, CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, Deployment Plan, Operations Runbook, Monitoring and Observability Plan, Service Level Agreement (SLA) Document, and Developer Documentation.
