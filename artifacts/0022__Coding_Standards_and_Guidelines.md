Coding Standards and Guidelines
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This Coding Standards and Guidelines document defines best practices for writing maintainable, secure, and consistent code across AIC-Platform’s microservices, AI/ML pipelines, data layer, and PaaS runtimes. It ensures high-quality software development, supports the SRD’s functional (e.g., FR1–FR15, FR33–FR45), non-functional (e.g., NFR9, NFR13–NFR23), and technical requirements (e.g., TR1, TR7), and aligns with the platform’s long-term goals of scalability, security, and developer productivity.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a standardized set of coding practices for AIC-Platform’s development teams, external contributors, and third-party developers building on the platform. It ensures code quality, reduces technical debt, and facilitates collaboration, while supporting the platform’s 20-year competitive moat through consistent, secure, and extensible codebases.

3. Coding Conventions
3.1 General Guidelines

Naming Conventions:
Variables: camelCase for JavaScript/Node.js, snake_case for Python/Go, camelCase or PascalCase for Java.
Functions: camelCase for all languages.
Classes: PascalCase (e.g., ModelTrainer).
Files: kebab-case (e.g., model-trainer.py).


Code Structure:
Modularize code into small, single-responsibility functions (max 50 lines).
Use packages/modules to organize microservices (FR1).
Follow REST/gRPC conventions for API endpoints (FR28).


Comments:
Include docstrings for all functions and classes.
Use inline comments sparingly, focusing on intent (e.g., // Handle OAuth token refresh).


Error Handling:
Use explicit error types (e.g., ValueError in Python, IllegalArgumentException in Java).
Return meaningful error messages via APIs (e.g., { "error": "Invalid input", "code": 400 }).


Formatting:
Indentation: 2 spaces (JavaScript, Python), 4 spaces (Java), tabs (Go).
Max line length: 80 characters (Python), 120 (others).



3.2 Language-Specific Guidelines

Python (used for AI/ML pipelines, FR8–FR15):
Follow PEP 8 standards.
Use type hints (e.g., def train(model: Model, data: List[float]) -> Model).
Example:def train_model(dataset_id: str, hyperparameters: dict) -> dict:
    """Train an AI model with given dataset and hyperparameters."""
    try:
        model = TensorFlowModel(hyperparameters)
        data = load_data(dataset_id)
        return {"model_id": model.train(data)}
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ModelTrainingError(f"Invalid dataset: {e}")




Java (used for enterprise microservices, FR1–FR4):
Follow Oracle Java Code Conventions.
Use dependency injection (Spring) for modularity.
Example:@Service
public class TransactionService {
    @Autowired
    private TransactionRepository repo;

    public Transaction processPayment(String accountId, double amount) {
        if (amount <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Amount must be positive");
        }
        return repo.save(new Transaction(accountId, amount));
    }
}




Node.js (used for developer portal, FR35):
Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide.
Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
Example:async function deployApp(appId, version) {
  try {
    const deployment = await api.deploy(appId, version);
    return { status: 'deployed', deploymentId: deployment.id };
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error(`Deployment failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}




Go (used for high-performance microservices, FR33):
Follow Go Code Review Comments.
Use explicit error handling.
Example:package main

func processEvent(eventID string, payload []byte) (string, error) {
    if len(payload) == 0 {
        return "", errors.New("empty payload")
    }
    result, err := saveEvent(eventID, payload)
    if err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("save failed: %v", err)
    }
    return result, nil
}





4. Security Best Practices

Input Validation:
Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL, XSS) (NFR13).
Use libraries like OWASP Java Encoder or Python’s bleach.


Authentication/Authorization:
Enforce OAuth 2.0 tokens for API calls (NFR15).
Implement RBAC checks in all microservices (e.g., if !user.hasRole("admin")).


Secure Communication:
Use mTLS for service-to-service communication via Istio (NFR13).
Encrypt sensitive data with AES-256 (NFR14).


Vulnerability Management:
Scan code with Snyk and Trivy in CI/CD pipelines (NFR16).
Example: trivy image my-app:latest.


Secrets Management:
Store secrets in HashiCorp Vault, accessed via SPIFFE/SPIRE (NFR19).
Example: vault kv get secret/api-key.


SRD Mappings: NFR13–NFR16, NFR19.

5. AI-Driven Code Generation

Purpose: Automate coding, testing, and optimization (FR15).
Guidelines:
Use AI-generated code as a starting point, reviewed by developers.
Apply same coding standards (e.g., naming, formatting) to AI-generated code.
Sandbox AI-generated code in WebAssembly for security (FR25).
Example:# AI-generated: Train model
def train_model_auto(dataset_id: str) -> dict:
    """Generated by AIC-Platform CodeGen."""
    model = AutoMLModel()  # Auto-generated model selection
    return {"model_id": model.fit(dataset_id)}




Integration: Generated code pushed to GitHub, validated via CI/CD (TR1).
SRD Mappings: FR15, FR25, TR1.

6. Version Control and GitOps

Repository Structure:
Monorepo for microservices, organized by domain (e.g., finance-service/, ai-pipeline/).
Separate repos for open-source components (e.g., CLI, observability tools).


Branching Model:
Main branch: main (production-ready).
Feature branches: feature/<name> (e.g., feature/synthetic-data).
Release branches: release/v1.0.


GitOps:
Use ArgoCD for declarative deployments (TR4).
Example: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml.


Commit Messages:
Format: <type>(<scope>): <description> (e.g., feat(ai): add model training endpoint).


SRD Mappings: TR4, IP Strategy (open-source).

7. Testing Standards

Unit Tests:
Cover 100% of critical functions (e.g., API handlers, model training).
Example (Python): assert train_model("789")["status"] == "success".


Integration Tests:
Test microservice interactions (e.g., API to database).
Use Pact for contract testing (TR8).


Performance Tests:
Validate <100ms API latency using Locust (NFR9).


Security Tests:
Run Snyk scans in CI/CD (NFR16).


Tools: PyTest, JUnit, Mocha, Go Test, Locust, Snyk (TR6–TR7).
SRD Mappings: TR6–TR8, NFR9, NFR16.

8. Documentation Standards

Code Documentation:
Docstrings for all functions/classes (e.g., Python: """Train an AI model.""").
Inline comments for complex logic (e.g., // Optimize hyperparameters).


API Documentation:
Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST/gRPC endpoints (FR28).
Example: paths: /v1/models/train: post: { description: "Train AI model" }.


Developer Guides:
Generated via Sphinx, linked to developer portal (NFR45).


SRD Mappings: NFR45, FR28, FR30.

9. Extensibility

Plugin Framework:
Support third-party plugins via standardized interfaces (FR27).
Example: Plugin manifest { "name": "logging", "endpoint": "/v1/plugin/log" }.


Future Compute:
Modular code to support quantum (Qiskit) and neuromorphic (Loihi) runtimes (TR22).


SRD Mappings: FR27, TR22.

10. Open-Source Compliance

Licenses:
Use MIT/Apache 2.0 for open-source components (e.g., CLI, observability) (IP Strategy).
Audit dependencies with Black Duck/FOSSA to ensure compliance.


Proprietary Code:
Protect core AI and PaaS layers (FR14, FR21) with restrictive licenses (IP Strategy).


SRD Mappings: IP Strategy, TR25.

11. Implementation Roadmap Alignment

Year 1–3: Define standards for Python, Java, Node.js, Go; integrate AI code generation (FR15).
Year 4–7: Add WebAssembly and plugin support (FR25, FR27).
Year 8–20: Extend for quantum and neuromorphic computing (TR22).

12. Risks and Mitigation

Risk 1: Inconsistent Code: Mitigated by linters and CI/CD checks (R1).
Risk 2: Security Vulnerabilities: Mitigated by Snyk scans and secure coding practices (R1, NFR16).
