Test Plan
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This Test Plan outlines the strategy for validating AIC-Platform’s functionality, performance, security, and compliance, ensuring it meets the SRD’s functional (e.g., FR1–FR45), non-functional (e.g., NFR1–NFR49), and technical requirements (e.g., TR6–TR8). The plan ensures the platform achieves 99.9999% uptime, <100ms API latency, and compliance with global regulations, supporting the goal of 2 million users and $2 billion ARR by 2045.
