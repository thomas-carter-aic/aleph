Year 1 Action Plan
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This Year 1 Action Plan outlines the quarter-by-quarter priorities for 2026 to initiate the AIC-Platform project, focusing on building the core platform, launching a beta program, securing initial partnerships, and establishing a developer community. It aligns with the 30 SRD artifacts (Product Vision Document, Business Case and Financial Model, Market Analysis Report, Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy, Intellectual Property (IP) Strategy, System Architecture Document (SAD), API Specification, Data Model and Schema Design, Security Architecture Document, AI/ML Pipeline Design, Coding Standards and Guidelines, Test Plan, CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Templates, Deployment Plan, Operations Runbook, Monitoring and Observability Plan, Service Level Agreement (SLA) Document, Developer Documentation, User Guides and Tutorials, Certification Program Curriculum, Community Guidelines, Compliance Plan, AI Ethics and Governance Framework, Risk Management Plan, Partnership Strategy Document, Open Standards Contribution Plan, R&D Roadmap, Sustainability Strategy, Global Expansion Plan) and the two additional artifacts (Consolidated Implementation Plan, Stakeholder Presentation Summary), supporting the goal of achieving 1,000 beta users and laying the foundation for 2 million users and $2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2045.
