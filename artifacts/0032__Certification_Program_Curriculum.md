Certification Program Curriculum
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This Certification Program Curriculum defines the training and certification program for developers, architects, and other technical professionals to build expertise in using AIC-Platform’s microservices, AI/ML pipelines, data layer, and PaaS capabilities. It addresses the SRD’s non-functional requirement (NFR47) for developer certifications, as well as functional requirements (e.g., FR1–FR45) and technical requirements (e.g., TR1–TR5, TR22), supporting the platform’s goal of achieving 10,000 certified developers, 2 million users, and $2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2045.
