AI Ethics and Governance Framework
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This AI Ethics and Governance Framework defines the policies, processes, and tools for ensuring ethical AI development and deployment on AIC-Platform, fostering transparency, fairness, and compliance with global standards. It addresses the SRD’s non-functional requirements (NFR37, NFR39), functional requirements (e.g., FR11, FR13, FR14, FR21), and technical requirements (e.g., TR14, TR22), supporting the platform’s goal of achieving 2 million users and $2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2045.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a framework for ethical AI practices, ensuring AIC-Platform’s AI models and applications are transparent, fair, and compliant with regulatory and ethical standards. It guides AI developers, compliance teams, and stakeholders in implementing responsible AI, aligning with the Product Vision Document, Business Case, Market Analysis Report, GTM Strategy, IP Strategy, System Architecture Document (SAD), API Specification, Data Model and Schema Design, Security Architecture Document, AI/ML Pipeline Design, Coding Standards and Guidelines, Test Plan, CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, Deployment Plan, Operations Runbook, Monitoring and Observability Plan, SLA Document, Developer Documentation, User Guides and Tutorials, Certification Program Curriculum, Community Guidelines, and Compliance Plan.

3. Ethical AI Processes
3.1 Fairness Policies

Purpose: Ensure equitable AI outcomes (NFR37).
Process:
Bias Detection: Use Fairlearn to measure bias across demographics (e.g., <0.1 bias threshold).
Mitigation: Apply reweighting or adversarial training to reduce bias.
Validation: Test models in CI/CD pipelines (TR1).from fairlearn.metrics import demographic_parity_difference
def test_model_fairness(model, test_data):
    bias = demographic_parity_difference(model.predict(test_data))
    assert bias < 0.1, "Bias exceeds threshold"


Reporting: Log bias metrics to Grafana (NFR33).


SRD Mappings: NFR37, FR13, TR1.

3.2 Model Explainability

Purpose: Provide transparent model outputs (FR13).
Process:
Generate explanations via /v1/models/{modelId}/explain API.curl -X GET https://AIC-Platform.io/v1/models/101/explain \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

Output: { "featureImportance": { "feature1": 0.4, "feature2": 0.3 } }.
Use SHAP/LIME for feature importance calculations.
Integrate explanations into developer portal (FR35).


Tools: SHAP, LIME.
SRD Mappings: FR13, NFR33, FR35.

3.3 Privacy Mechanisms

Purpose: Protect user data during AI training and inference (FR11, NFR20).
Process:
Federated Learning: Use TensorFlow Federated for decentralized training.from tensorflow_federated import federated_computation
@federated_computation
def train_federated_model(data):
    return aggregate_model_updates(data)


Differential Privacy: Apply noise to usage data (FR22).from tensorflow_privacy import DPKerasSGDOptimizer
model.compile(optimizer=DPKerasSGDOptimizer(epsilon=1.0))


Validate privacy in CI/CD tests (TR1).


SRD Mappings: FR11, NFR20, FR22, TR1.

3.4 AI Ethics Certification
