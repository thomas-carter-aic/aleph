Developer Documentation
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This Developer Documentation provides comprehensive guidance for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications on AIC-Platform, leveraging its microservices, AI/ML pipelines, data layer, and PaaS capabilities. It addresses the SRD’s functional requirements (e.g., FR1–FR45), non-functional requirements (e.g., NFR9, NFR13–NFR33, NFR44–NFR47), and technical requirements (e.g., TR1–TR5), supporting the platform’s goal of achieving 2 million users and $2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2045.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to guide developers (internal, external, and third-party contributors) in using AIC-Platform’s tools, APIs, and services to create, deploy, and monitor applications. It ensures ease of onboarding, productivity, and alignment with the Product Vision Document, Business Case, Market Analysis Report, GTM Strategy, IP Strategy, System Architecture Document (SAD), API Specification, Data Model and Schema Design, Security Architecture Document, AI/ML Pipeline Design, Coding Standards and Guidelines, Test Plan, CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, Deployment Plan, Operations Runbook, Monitoring and Observability Plan, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) Document.
