3. Operational Procedures
3.1 Incident Response

Purpose: Resolve outages, performance issues, and security incidents (NFR31).
Procedure:
Detection: Alerts triggered via Prometheus (e.g., CPU > 80%, latency > 100ms).
Notification: Send alerts to PagerDuty with severity levels (critical, warning).
Diagnosis: Analyze logs/traces in ELK Stack or Grafana (NFR29–NFR30).
Resolution: Apply fixes (e.g., scale pods, restart services).
Post-Mortem: Log incident to CloudTrail, update runbook (NFR34).


Example:# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n AIC-Platform
# Scale deployment
kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=5
# View logs
kubectl logs my-app-pod


SRD Mappings: NFR29–NFR31, NFR34.

3.2 Health Checks and Auto-Restart

Purpose: Ensure self-healing systems (NFR27).
Procedure:
Health Checks: Configure liveness/readiness probes in Kubernetes.
Example: livenessProbe: httpGet: { path: "/health", port: 8080 }.


Auto-Restart: Restart failed pods automatically.
Monitoring: Track health metrics in Prometheus (e.g., kube_pod_status_ready).
Escalation: Alert SREs via PagerDuty for persistent failures.


Example:apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 10


SRD Mappings: NFR27, NFR29.

3.3 Backup and Disaster Recovery

Purpose: Ensure data and application recovery with minimal RTO/RPO (NFR7).
Procedure:
Backup: Schedule daily backups with Velero for Kubernetes resources and AWS Backup for databases.
Example: velero backup create aic-platform-backup --include-namespaces AIC-Platform.


Replication: Replicate data across regions (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1) (NFR3).
Recovery: Restore from latest backup on failure.
Example: velero restore create --from-backup aic-platform-backup.


Testing: Conduct quarterly DR drills.


Metrics: RTO < 5 minutes, RPO < 1 minute.
SRD Mappings: NFR7, NFR3.

Rotation: Rotate logs daily, retain 7 days in hot storage (Redis).
Archiving: Move logs to S3 (cold storage) with lifecycle policy (30 days).
Audit: Log access events to CloudTrail (NFR34).


Example:# Configure Fluentd
fluentd --config /etc/fluentd/fluentd.conf
# Archive logs
aws s3 sync /logs s3://aic-platform-logs --delete
