Open Standards Contribution Plan
1. Introduction
The AIC AIPaas Platform (AIC-Platform) is a next-generation, enterprise-grade, production-ready, AI-native, and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution designed to deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent applications with a 20-year competitive moat. This Open Standards Contribution Plan outlines the strategy for contributing to and leading open standards in PaaS interoperability, AI model deployment, and data exchange, positioning AIC-Platform as the reference implementation to drive ecosystem adoption and industry influence. It addresses the SRD’s technical requirement (TR25), functional requirements (e.g., FR27, FR31, FR32, FR40), and non-functional requirements (e.g., NFR47), supporting the platform’s goal of achieving 20,000 marketplace integrations, 10,000 certified developers, 2 million users, and $2 billion in annual recurring revenue (ARR) by 2045.
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the approach for AIC-Platform’s contributions to open standards bodies, such as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), IEEE, and Apache Foundation, ensuring the platform shapes industry standards while maintaining a competitive edge. It guides technical teams, partnership managers, and community contributors in aligning standards contributions with AIC-Platform’s ecosystem and IP strategies, aligning with the Product Vision Document, Business Case, Market Analysis Report, GTM Strategy, IP Strategy, System Architecture Document (SAD), API Specification, Data Model and Schema Design, Security Architecture Document, AI/ML Pipeline Design, Coding Standards and Guidelines, Test Plan, CI/CD Pipeline Configuration, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Templates, Deployment Plan, Operations Runbook, Monitoring and Observability Plan, SLA Document, Developer Documentation, User Guides and Tutorials, Certification Program Curriculum, Community Guidelines, Compliance Plan, AI Ethics and Governance Framework, Risk Management Plan, and Partnership Strategy Document.
